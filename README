What is WebInject?

WebInject is a free tool for automated testing of web applications and
web services. It can be used to test individual system components that
have HTTP interfaces (JSP, ASP, CGI, PHP, AJAX, Servlets, HTML Forms,
XML/SOAP Web Services, REST, etc), and can be used as a test harness
to create a suite of [HTTP level] automated functional, acceptance,
and regression tests. A test harness allows you to run many test cases
and collect/report your results. WebInject offers real-time results
display and may also be used for monitoring system response times.

WebInject can be used as a complete test framework that is controlled
by the WebInject User Interface (GUI). Optionally, it can be used as a
standalone test runner (text/console application) which can be
integrated and called from other test frameworks or applications. 

Installation

We need to install a few prerequisite Perl modules for the test runner:

 Module::Install
 Module::Install::ReadmeFromPod
 LWP::Protocol::https
 XML::Simple
 XML::Parser

These can either be installed via CPAN or from your favourite package
manager. For example, on Fedora Linux:

 dnf install perl-Module-Install perl-Module-Install-ReadmeFromPod \
     perl-libwww-perl perl-LWP-Protocol-https perl-XML-Simple \
     perl-XML-Parser

For Debian based systems:

 apt install libmodule-install-perl libmodule-install-readmefrompod-perl \
     libwww-perl liblwp-protocol-https-perl libxml-simple-perl \
     libxml-parser-perl

With those in place, the test runner can be installed:

 cd Webinject
 perl Makefile.PL
 make
 sudo make install
